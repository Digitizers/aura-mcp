# Connect Claude to the Aura control plane

Two steps: **mint a management token** in Aura, then **point an MCP client** at the gateway.
The token is a credential — treat it like a password. Do the wiring only on the user's
explicit confirmation.

## 1. Mint a `canManage` management token

1. Sign in to Aura at **https://app.my-aura.app**.
2. Open the **Fleet** page → **Agent Tokens**.
3. Create a new token and check **"allow manage"** — this is the `canManage` flag that
   unlocks the `aura__*` control-plane tools. Grant it sparingly; it is strictly higher
   privilege than a normal execution token.
4. **Scope it.** The token is bound to your organization + a client. To restrict it to one
   Site Group, set its pack — but note the **reverts** (`aura__restore_snapshot`,
   `aura__rollback_run`) require a **client-wide** token and will refuse a pack-scoped one.
5. **For the high-risk writes**, add their names to the token's **allowed tools** — they are
   NOT granted by default:
   - `aura__restore_snapshot`
   - `aura__rollback_run`
   - `aura__approve_action` (also needs org opt-in — see [safety.md](safety.md))

   Leave allowed-tools empty for a read-only + `reject_action` token (the safe default).
6. **Copy the token** — it's shown **once**, in the form `aura_` followed by 48 hex
   characters. Store it in a secret manager, not in a committed file.

## 2. Wire the MCP client

The gateway speaks MCP over HTTP at **`https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet`**, authenticated
with `Authorization: Bearer aura_…`. On a management token, `tools/list` includes the
`aura__*` tools alongside the fleet's site/infra/content tools.

### Claude Code — `.mcp.json` in your project root
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aura": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer aura_YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Add `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore` — it embeds the token.

### Claude Desktop — `claude_desktop_config.json`
(`%APPDATA%\Claude\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on macOS)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aura": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer aura_YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor — `.cursor/mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aura": {
      "url": "https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer aura_YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Self-hosted Aura
Replace the host with your deployment's app URL, keeping the `/api/mcp/fleet` path. Override
via `AURA_MCP_URL` if the skill's tooling reads it.

## 3. Verify

Ask the client to list tools, or call `aura__client_summary`. If you see the `aura__*` tools
and a summary comes back, you're connected. If `aura__*` tools are **absent**, the token
almost certainly lacks `canManage` — re-mint with "allow manage" checked.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| No `aura__*` tools in `tools/list` | Token isn't `canManage`. Re-mint with "allow manage". |
| `Unauthorized: invalid or expired agent token` | Bad/rotated token, or malformed header. Must be `Bearer aura_<48 hex>`. |
| Write returns `PACK_SCOPED_TOKEN` | Reverts need a client-wide token; this one is pack-scoped. |
| Write returns `ORG_OPT_IN_REQUIRED` | Machine-approve is off for the org — approve in the Aura UI, or an admin enables it. |
| `aura__approve_action` not callable | Add it to the token's allowed-tools (explicit opt-in), and confirm org opt-in. |
