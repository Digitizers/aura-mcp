# Connect Claude to the Aura control plane

Two steps: **mint a management token** in Aura, then **point an MCP client** at the gateway.
The token is a credential — treat it like a password. Do the wiring only on the user's
explicit confirmation.

## 1. Mint a `canManage` management token

1. Sign in to Aura at **https://app.my-aura.app**.
2. Open the **Fleet** page → **Agent Tokens**.
3. Create a new token and check **"allow manage"** — this is the `canManage` flag that
   unlocks the `aura__*` control-plane tools. Grant it sparingly; it is strictly higher
   privilege than a normal execution token.
4. **Scope it.** The token is bound to your organization + a client. To restrict it to one
   Site Group, set its pack — but note the **reverts** (`aura__restore_snapshot`,
   `aura__rollback_run`) require a **client-wide** token and will refuse a pack-scoped one.
5. **For the high-risk writes**, add their names to the token's **allowed tools** — they are
   NOT granted by default:
   - `aura__restore_snapshot`
   - `aura__rollback_run`
   - `aura__approve_action` (also needs org opt-in — see [safety.md](safety.md))

   **A read-only token must use an explicit allow-list — do NOT leave it empty.** An empty
   `allowedTools` means *unrestricted*: a `canManage` token can then call every read **and
   mutating** fleet tool it can reach (site / infra / content ops), excepting only the three
   high-risk `aura__*` writes listed above. For a genuinely read-only (+ deny) token, allow-list
   only the read tools you need — `aura__list_pending_approvals`, `aura__get_action`,
   `aura__list_snapshots`, `aura__list_connections`, `aura__list_runs`, `aura__client_summary` —
   plus `aura__reject_action` (deny-only, can never execute). Leave `allowedTools` empty **only**
   for a fully-trusted operator token that is meant to run everything.
6. **Copy the token** — it's shown **once**, in the form `aura_` followed by 48 hex
   characters. Store it in a secret manager, not in a committed file.

## 2. Wire the MCP client

The gateway speaks MCP over HTTP at **`https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet`**, authenticated
with `Authorization: Bearer aura_…`. On a management token, `tools/list` includes the
`aura__*` tools alongside the fleet's site/infra/content tools.

### Claude Code — env var (zero-config, devices and cloud sessions)

This repo commits a placeholder-only `.mcp.json` whose `Authorization` header reads
`Bearer ${AURA_MCP_TOKEN:-}`. Set that variable — in your shell profile on a device, or in the
claude.ai cloud environment's environment variables for web/phone sessions — and the `aura`
connection authenticates automatically. While the variable is unset the config still parses
(the `:-` default), but the connection can't authenticate and shows as unavailable in `/mcp` —
that's expected until you provide the token. Never put a real token in the tracked
`.mcp.json`. Cloud environments with a restricted network policy must allow
`app.my-aura.app`.

In a project of your own, the equivalent explicit config is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aura": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer aura_YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
If you inline a real token like this, keep that `.mcp.json` out of version control
(gitignore it) — or better, keep the `${AURA_MCP_TOKEN:-}` placeholder and export the
token in your environment.

### Claude Desktop — `claude_desktop_config.json`
(`%APPDATA%\Claude\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on macOS)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aura": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer aura_YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor — `.cursor/mcp.json`

Cursor interpolates environment variables in MCP config with `${env:VAR}` — use it so the
token stays out of the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aura": {
      "url": "https://app.my-aura.app/api/mcp/fleet",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:AURA_MCP_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Self-hosted Aura
Replace the host with your deployment's app URL, keeping the `/api/mcp/fleet` path. Override
via `AURA_MCP_URL` if the skill's tooling reads it.

## 3. Verify

Ask the client to list tools, or call `aura__client_summary`. If you see the `aura__*` tools
and a summary comes back, you're connected. If `aura__*` tools are **absent**, the token
almost certainly lacks `canManage` — re-mint with "allow manage" checked.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| No `aura__*` tools in `tools/list` | Token isn't `canManage`. Re-mint with "allow manage". |
| `Unauthorized: invalid or expired agent token` | Bad/rotated token, or malformed header. Must be `Bearer aura_<48 hex>`. |
| Write returns `PACK_SCOPED_TOKEN` | Reverts need a client-wide token; this one is pack-scoped. |
| Write returns `ORG_OPT_IN_REQUIRED` | Machine-approve is off for the org — approve in the Aura UI, or an admin enables it. |
| `aura__approve_action` not callable | Add it to the token's allowed-tools (explicit opt-in), and confirm org opt-in. |
